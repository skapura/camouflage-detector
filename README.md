# Camouflage Detector
Term project that detects artificial camouflage patterns in natural settings and compares different approaches.
The project also evaluates how differences in the features of camouflage patterns impact the ability for models to discriminate them with natural scenery.

CADPAT (Canadian Pattern) and MARPAT (Marine Corps Pattern) work best with some amount of false positives:

Pencott pattern blends the best in some settings and is more difficult to differentiate:
